    <h3 class="aboutHeader">Background</h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is Kevin and I am currently living in the beautiful city of Portland, Oregon. I am originally from Washington and am an aspiring software engineer. I fell in love with programming back in February of 2018 and have not stopped learning since. I enjoy both front-end and back-end programming and my goal is to become a full-stack developer.</p>
    <p>I am currently in Epicodus, a coding bootcamp based in Portland, Oregon, and am taking the C# / React Track. I enjoy using <span class="enjoyments">HTML</span>, <span class="enjoyments">CSS</span> and <span class="enjoyments">JavaScript</span>, along with <span class="enjoyments">BootStrap</span>, <span class="enjoyments">jQuery</span>, <span class="enjoyments">Angular</span> and <span class="enjoyments">React</span> for the front-end. For the back-end, I enjoy using <span class="enjoyments">C#/.NET</span> with the <span class="enjoyments">Entity</span> framework, <span class="enjoyments">SQL</span> and <span class="enjoyments">MySQL</span></p>
